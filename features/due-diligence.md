title: Leveraging SBOMs for Effective Mergers and Acquisitions Due Diligence
---

In the critical phase of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), understanding the composition of the software assets you’re acquiring is paramount. The landscape of software is complex, with dependencies, licensing, and potential vulnerabilities that can significantly impact the value and operational continuity of an acquisition. This is where Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) comes into play, offering a comprehensive audit tool for evaluating a company's software dependencies.

#### License Compliance

One of the primary challenges in M&A due diligence is ensuring license compliance. When acquiring a company, you inherit all their software assets, including those that may be subject to open-source licenses such as GPL (General Public License). Non-compliance with these licenses can lead to legal liabilities and operational disruptions.

SBOMs provide an automated solution to this challenge by offering detailed insights into the licenses associated with each software component. By using tools like sbomify, acquirers can quickly identify any GPL-licensed code within the codebase. This allows legal teams to assess compliance and address any potential issues before they become problematic. Automating this process not only saves time but also reduces the risk of overlooking critical licensing information, ensuring that your acquisition aligns with your company’s compliance standards and policies.

#### Detecting Technical Debt

Technical debt is another significant factor that can affect the valuation and integration process during M&A. Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. It includes outdated code, poor documentation, and other inefficiencies that can slow down future development and increase maintenance costs.

SBOMs enable acquiring companies to detect and assess the technical debt of the target company's software stack. By providing a comprehensive overview of all software components, SBOMs help identify areas where outdated or inefficient code is used. Tools like sbomify can analyze the codebase to highlight these problematic areas, allowing you to estimate the effort required to address technical debt post-acquisition. This proactive approach helps in making informed decisions, ensuring that the true cost of the acquisition is understood and accounted for.

#### Identifying End-of-Life Components

Another crucial aspect of software due diligence is identifying end-of-life (EOL) components. Software components that are no longer supported by their developers can pose significant security risks and operational challenges. Unsupported software may not receive critical security updates, leaving the system vulnerable to exploits and breaches.

SBOMs provide visibility into the lifecycle status of each software component. By identifying EOL components, SBOMs allow companies to plan for necessary upgrades or replacements before finalizing the acquisition. This foresight prevents the inherited burden of maintaining or securing obsolete software, ensuring that the acquired software stack remains robust and secure.

#### Enhancing M&A Reporting and Compliance Assurance

Integrating SBOMs into the M&A due diligence process enhances reporting and compliance assurance. With sbomify, companies can generate detailed reports that provide a clear picture of the software assets’ composition, licensing, technical debt, and lifecycle status. These reports facilitate better communication and understanding among stakeholders, from technical teams to legal advisors, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

Moreover, SBOMs offer a standardized approach to software audits, making it easier to compare and evaluate different acquisition targets. This standardization is crucial for companies with multiple acquisitions, as it ensures consistency in the evaluation process.

#### A Lightweight, Automated Audit Solution

Traditionally, software audits during M&A due diligence have been manual, time-consuming, and expensive processes. However, with the advent of SBOMs, this is no longer the case. SBOMs offer a lightweight, automated audit solution that drastically reduces the time and cost associated with manual audits.

Tools like sbomify streamline the audit process, providing fast and accurate insights into the software stack without the need for extensive manual intervention. This efficiency not only accelerates the due diligence process but also frees up resources that can be better utilized elsewhere. By embracing SBOMs, companies can conduct thorough audits with confidence and ease, ensuring their acquisitions are sound and well-informed.

In summary, SBOMs are revolutionizing the M&A due diligence landscape by offering automated, detailed, and actionable insights into software assets. With tools like sbomify, you can confidently perform comprehensive audits, ensuring that your acquisitions are aligned with your company’s policies, standards, and strategic goals.
