title: The Growing Importance of SBOMs in Cybersecurity Compliance
---

In recent years, the landscape of cybersecurity has rapidly evolved, driven in large part by increasing awareness of vulnerabilities within software supply chains. A significant milestone in this evolution was the introduction of [Executive Order 14028](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/17/2021-10460/improving-the-nations-cybersecurity) by the US government in May 2021. This executive order was a direct response to the escalating cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure, government agencies, and private enterprises. A key component of this order was the mandate for Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for all vendors selling software to the federal government.

The mandate to produce SBOMs has had a profound and widespread impact, resonating across the entire software industry. SBOMs, which detail the components that make up a piece of software, are now recognized as an essential tool for ensuring transparency and security within the software supply chain. The cascading effect of this requirement has been particularly evident in compliance-related areas. Major regulatory frameworks and standards bodies have begun to incorporate or reference SBOMs in their guidelines, underscoring their importance. For example, the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act is set to introduce stringent requirements around software transparency, and in the United States, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework has highlighted SBOMs as a critical element of comprehensive cybersecurity practices.

As regulatory bodies and industry standards increasingly emphasize SBOMs, it is becoming clear that they are poised to become the de facto standard for transparency in the software supply chain. Organizations that have not yet implemented SBOM practices are at risk of falling behind, not only in compliance but also in their overall cybersecurity posture. The pressure to adopt SBOMs is mounting, and the benefits are substantial: enhanced visibility into software components, the ability to identify and address vulnerabilities more effectively, and stronger trust with customers and partners.

In this evolving environment, time is of the essence. Organizations that delay in adopting SBOMs may find themselves out of step with regulatory requirements and industry best practices. More critically, they may expose themselves to heightened risks in an era where cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated and pervasive. For those who have yet to integrate SBOMs into their software development and procurement processes, the clock is ticking. The move towards SBOMs is not just a matter of compliance; it’s a vital step towards ensuring the security and resilience of the software that underpins modern society.
