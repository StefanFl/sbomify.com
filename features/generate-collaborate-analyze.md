title: Automating SBOM Collaboration with sbomify

---

The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) life cycle comprises three key stages:

* [Generation]({{ site.url }}/resources/#generation)
* [Collaboration]({{ site.url }}/resources/#collaboration)
* [Analysis]({{ site.url }}/resources/#analysis)

While each of these stages is critical for maintaining transparency and security in the software supply chain, collaboration is often the most challenging. SBOMs need to be shared effectively with both internal teams and external stakeholders, including customers and partners. Unfortunately, current practices for SBOM collaboration are often outdated and inefficient. After discussions with CTOs and Chief Security Architects (CSAs), it became evident that many organizations still rely on email to share SBOMs, a method reminiscent of how software patches were distributed in the 1990s. These SBOMs are then often stored ad-hoc on internal file shares, leading to a host of issues such as unnecessary manual labor, disorganized storage, and the risk of working with outdated data.

The inefficiencies of traditional SBOM collaboration methods are not just inconvenient—they pose significant risks to the integrity and security of the software supply chain. As highlighted in the [CISA SBOM Sharing Primer](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/SBOM%20Sharing%20Primer.pdf), effective SBOM sharing is crucial for enhancing visibility and managing risk. The document outlines best practices for sharing SBOMs and emphasizes the need for standardized, automated processes. It also warns against the dangers of relying on manual methods, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors that compromise the entire software ecosystem. The current state of SBOM collaboration in many organizations is far from the ideal outlined by CISA, indicating a pressing need for better tools and workflows.

This is where sbomify comes in. sbomify focuses on automating the collaboration aspect of the SBOM life cycle, ensuring that SBOMs are shared seamlessly and securely. By integrating directly into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow, sbomify eliminates the need for manual SBOM distribution and ad-hoc storage solutions. Instead of relying on email chains and disparate file shares, organizations can use sbomify to automate the sharing process, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to the most up-to-date and accurate SBOM data. This not only reduces labor but also enhances security by minimizing the risk of outdated or incorrect information being circulated.

The importance of automating SBOM collaboration cannot be overstated. As the software industry increasingly recognizes the value of SBOMs for transparency and security, the need for efficient and secure collaboration tools becomes paramount. Solutions like sbomify address these needs directly, providing a modern approach that aligns with the best practices outlined by CISA. For organizations looking to streamline their SBOM processes and enhance their cybersecurity posture, adopting an automated, integrated solution like sbomify is not just a smart choice—it’s a necessary one.
