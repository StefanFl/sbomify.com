<p>In an era where digital security is paramount, the recent Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation&rsquo;s Cybersecurity has set a new precedent for software supply chain security, emphasizing the critical role of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in enhancing transparency and trustworthiness in software products. As a provider of SBOM management software, we are at the forefront of supporting organizations to navigate and comply with these new mandates, ensuring that your software supply chain is secure, compliant, and resilient against cyber threats.</p>

<p>The Executive Order marks a pivotal moment in cybersecurity policy, directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop guidelines for improving software supply chain security. One of the cornerstone achievements of this initiative is the formalization of the SBOM&mdash;a comprehensive record of the components that make up software products. This development is not just a regulatory milestone; it's a transformative step towards ensuring that organizations can identify, manage, and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.</p>
